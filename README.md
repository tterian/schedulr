A simple showcase of AngularJS consuming Ruby on Rails backend API.

## Cool Stuff

* RESTful API
* Rails generates JSON response through `gem 'responders'`:
`/users/:id/orders/:id`
* Frontend CSS is based on ZURB Foundation framework
* Frontend assets are served by Bower (except Foundation)
 -  `"angular"`
 -  `"angular-mocks"`
 -  `"angular-route"`
 -  `"angular-animate"`
 -  `"angular-resource"`
* AngularJS app uses following dependences
 - `ngResource`
 - `ngRoute`
* CSRF protection
* Real-time searching users/orders
* Real-time user filtering

## Not So Cool Stuff (Known Issues) 

* Priority ribbon on users page need to be aligned

## To the Future and Beyond

* Add image uploading feature
* Add pagination in users, orders pages
* Add advanced filtering support above sorting panel
* Make sure the app is awesome!
